For example you should write your own code to ensure that a userId passed as the path param must be a valid ObjectId and in such a case the error should be handled within the try block and not the catch block. This applies to all the validations whose failure lead to a 500 error. A valid error should be 400, 401, 403 or 404, as the case may be.",
